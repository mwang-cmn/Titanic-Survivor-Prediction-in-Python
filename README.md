# Titanic Disaster - Survivor Prediction in Python 

### Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a classifier model in Python which can predict which passengers on the Titanic were more likely to survive. The project uses a Decision tree classifier model to make predictions.
# Model Performance
The data used in this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
The Decision tree Classifier performed with an accuracy of 81%.
